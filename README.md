2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

My biggest challenge was to keep inside the specs of the project. I like design and aesthetics, and love games, being able to make a memory game was quite a fun experience. As someone who likes to challenge itself to learn more, I tried diferent ways where one could tile the blocks while keeping it tidy. I learned more about css grids and more about inline layouts. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)




I spread the time i worked on the project into small chunks, so, for example, one day i would work 2 hours, then another could be 1, then maybe one day i could work on it for 30 minutes on the morning, then 30 more on the afternoon, and 40 on nighttime. The reason is well, taking other courses and time management.
